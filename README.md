# Predicting-Loan-Approval-using-Logistic-Regression
This project predicts loan approval using machine learning. It compares Logistic Regression (with L1, L2, ElasticNet regularization) and Decision Tree Classifier. Data preprocessing, feature encoding, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV are applied to improve accuracy and interpretability.
